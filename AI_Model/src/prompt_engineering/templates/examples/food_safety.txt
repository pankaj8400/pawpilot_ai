EXPECTED OUTPUT:

🚨 POTENTIAL TOXICITY - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

## Food Item Analyzed
Chocolate Birthday Cake

## Toxicity Assessment
⚠️ **POTENTIALLY TOXIC - Action Required**

## Toxic Components Identified
🚨 **Chocolate** - Contains theobromine (toxic to dogs)

## Severity Calculation
For 5kg dog eating chocolate cake:
- Amount eaten: ~2 bites (estimated 10-15g)
- If dark chocolate: MODERATE risk
- If milk chocolate: LOW-MODERATE risk
- If white chocolate: No theobromine (not toxic)

## Risk Level
🟠 **MODERATE - Depends on chocolate type**

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED
1. **Determine chocolate type** - Dark/milk/white? (Check cake recipe or ask baker)
2. **If Dark Chocolate**: CALL YOUR VET IMMEDIATELY
   - Small dogs are at higher risk
   - Timeline: Symptoms appear in 1-4 hours
   - Can continue 8-12 hours
3. **If Milk Chocolate**: Monitor closely, call vet if symptoms appear
4. **If White Chocolate**: Not toxic, but monitor for stomach upset from sugar/fat

## Symptoms to Watch For (Next 12 hours)
- Vomiting or diarrhea
- Restlessness, hyperactivity
- Rapid heartbeat
- Muscle tremors
- Excessive panting

## When to Seek Emergency Care
Seek IMMEDIATE emergency vet care if:
- Seizures occur
- Collapse or extreme lethargy
- Difficulty breathing
- Severe vomiting

## Treatment
- Vet may induce vomiting (if caught early, <2 hours)
- Activated charcoal (prevents absorption)
- Monitoring for 24-48 hours

## Product Analysis: [Brand Name] Dog Food

## 🔍 Ingredients Review
Main Ingredients: Beef, brown rice, sweet potato, fish meal, chicken by-products, corn meal...

## ✅ Positive Aspects
- Beef as primary protein (good for chicken allergy)

## Allergen Risk
- Chicken content: 🚨 High Risk (will trigger allergy)
- Corn content: ⚠️ Moderate Risk (may trigger sensitivity)
- Expected reaction: Itching, skin issues, diarrhea within 2-7 days

## Better Alternatives
1. **Limited Ingredient Diet with Beef Base**
   - Contains only: Beef, sweet potato, peas, carrots
   - No chicken, corn, or common fillers
   
2. **Hydrolyzed Protein Diet**
   - For sensitive digestion
   - Proteins broken down for easier absorption
   
3. **Fish-based Diet**
   - Primary protein is fish instead of chicken
   - High omega-3 for skin health

## Portion Recommendation
**DO NOT FEED** due to allergen content

## Final Recommendation
❌ **DO NOT USE** - Will cause allergic reactions
✅ **SWITCH TO**: Grain-free, chicken-free alternative with limited ingredients
