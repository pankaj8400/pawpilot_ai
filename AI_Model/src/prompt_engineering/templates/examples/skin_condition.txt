PET PROFILE:
- Name: Max
- Breed: Golden Retriever
- Age: 5 years
- Allergies: None known
- Medical history: Ear infections in past

EXPECTED OUTPUT:

## Observations
Acute wet dermatitis (hot spot) with rapid onset and progression. Dog actively licking the area, causing further damage.

## Possible Conditions
1. **Hot spot (Acute Moist Dermatitis)** - VERY HIGH likelihood
   - Sudden onset, wet appearance, rapid spread, intense itching
   - Common in long-haired breeds like Golden Retrievers
   - Caused by: allergies, flea bite, stress, or moisture (bathing, swimming)

2. **Flea allergy dermatitis** - MEDIUM likelihood
   - If hot spot caused by flea bite reaction

3. **Skin infection (bacterial)** - MEDIUM likelihood
   - Secondary infection from licking/scratching

## Severity Level
🟠 **MEDIUM** - Painful but not life-threatening. Worsens quickly if untreated.

## Urgency for Vet Visit
⏰ **Within 24-48 hours** - Can worsen rapidly if left untreated.

## First Aid Steps (Do NOW)
1. **Trim hair around area** - Carefully clip matted fur to allow air circulation
2. **Clean gently** - Use lukewarm water and mild soap, pat dry thoroughly
3. **Prevent licking** - Apply Elizabethan collar immediately (very important!)
4. **Do NOT apply** - Avoid random creams; most worsen the condition
5. **Keep dry** - No swimming or baths until cleared by vet

## Monitoring
- Watch for: Increased redness, pus, swelling, spreading to other areas
- Monitor daily: Take photos to track size changes
- Red flags for escalation:
  - Spread beyond fist-sized area
  - Pus or discharge
  - Fever or lethargy
  - Not improving after 48 hours

## Vet Visit Recommendation

Example 2: Ear Infection (Otitis)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

"My dog keeps scratching his ear and shaking his head. There's a foul smell coming from his ear. He seems uncomfortable."

PET PROFILE:
- Name: Charlie
- Breed: Labrador Retriever
- Age: 3 years
- Allergies: Chicken (food allergy)
- Medical history: Recurring ear infections

EXPECTED OUTPUT:

## Observations
Signs consistent with ear infection: head shaking, scratching, odor. History of recurring infections increases likelihood.

## Possible Conditions
1. **Bacterial ear infection (Otitis Externa)** - VERY HIGH likelihood
   - Foul smell is classic sign
   - Head shaking and scratching are primary symptoms
   - Recurrent history suggests predisposition

2. **Yeast infection (Malassezia)** - HIGH likelihood
   - Often accompanies bacterial infection
   - Common in Labradors and floppy-eared breeds
   - May have different smell (musty/corn chips odor)

3. **Ear mites** - MEDIUM likelihood
   - More common in puppies but possible at any age
   - Usually less foul-smelling than bacterial

4. **Foreign object or water** - LOW likelihood
   - Possible if recent water exposure

## Severity Level
🟠 **MEDIUM** - Painful and can worsen, but not immediately dangerous

## Urgency for Vet Visit
⏰ **Within 24-48 hours** - Needs professional cleaning and treatment

## First Aid Steps (Do NOW)
1. **Do NOT put water in ear** - Will worsen infection
2. **Do NOT use cotton swabs deep in ear** - Risk damaging eardrum
3. **Gently clean outer ear** - Use soft cloth, do NOT probe deep
4. **Prevent scratching** - Keep nails trimmed, consider cone if severe
5. **Avoid triggers** - Don't bathe until infection cleared

## Monitoring
- Watch for: Increased discharge, bleeding, swelling of ear flap, head tilt, balance issues
- Red flags for emergency:
  - Head tilt or loss of balance (inner ear infection)
  - Blood or pus draining
  - Severe swelling
  - Fever or lethargy

## Vet Visit Recommendation
✅ **See vet within 24 hours**. The vet will:
- Clean ear thoroughly (needs professional equipment)

- Discuss prevention strategies

## Prevention Tips
- For floppy-eared breeds: Keep ears dry and clean
- Address food allergies (you noted chicken allergy)
- Regular ear checks
